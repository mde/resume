        <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p>
          I have been working on interactive Web applications for over 25 years. I have written a book on JavaScript development, presented at technical conferences worldwide, and am still heavily involved in open source (as author and maintainer of the EJS templating language for JavaScript). I have worked at large companies and tiny startups, and have a broad range of experience and expertise — from engineering management and processes, to hands-on engineering work, to interface design and HCI. I have worked as an individual contributor, lead teams, and have built and managed teams of both technical and creative people.
          I am always looking for the chance to learn something new. My ideal position would be working on a product that improves the lives of ordinary people.
